# Genetic Algorithm Tech Talk

Demo for Fullstack Academy tech talk that visualizes solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem with a genetic algorithm in 5 mins.

## The algorithm

Check out population.js and individual.js for the bulk of the algorithm.
The front-end ticking + drawing logic gets a little hairy but check out index.js + utils.js if you would like to.

Check out notes.txt for a few example configurations (I recommend keeping mutation very low)!
